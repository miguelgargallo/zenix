Three js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. The library is built on top of WebGL, which is a low-level API for rendering 3D graphics in a web browser. Three js provides a higher-level API that makes it easier for developers to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser.

There are several benefits to using Three js when creating 3D graphics for the web.
- Ease of use: Three js provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy for developers to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser. The library includes many built-in objects, such as cameras, lights, and materials, that can be used to create complex 3D scenes.
- Compatibility: Three js works seamlessly with other popular front-end technologies, such as React, Angular, and Vue. This makes it easy for developers to integrate 3D graphics into their existing web applications.
- Performance: Three js is optimized for performance and can handle large and complex 3D scenes with ease. The library uses WebGL to render 3D graphics, which provides high performance and allows for real-time rendering of 3D graphics in a web browser.
- Community: Three js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the library, share resources and offer support. This makes it easy for developers to find solutions to any problems they may encounter while using the library.
- Flexibility: Three js is a versatile library that can be used to create a wide range of 3D graphics, including interactive animations, virtual reality experiences, and 3D visualizations. The library includes support for many popular 3D file formats, such as OBJ, STL, and FBX, which makes it easy for developers to import and display 3D models in their applications.

In conclusion, Three js is a powerful and versatile JavaScript library that makes it easy for developers to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser. With its ease of use, compatibility with other front-end technologies, high performance, active community, and flexibility, Three js is a great choice for developers looking to add 3D graphics to their web applications.
